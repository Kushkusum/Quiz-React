## Features
1. Start Quiz

   Users can start the quiz with a button that triggers the fetching of quiz questions from the API. The app presents the questions one by one, with a timer for each question.

2. Multiple-Choice Questions

   Each question is displayed with multiple-choice options. The user selects an option, and the app checks if it is correct. The user is notified with a sound (correct or incorrect).

3. Timer
   
   Each question has a countdown timer, which gives the user a limited amount of time to answer. If the timer runs out, the answer is automatically marked as incorrect.

4. Gamification
   
   Scores: The user earns points for correct answers. Points are tracked throughout the quiz.

   Ranks: After completing the quiz, the user is given a rank based on their score (Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze).
 
   Badges: The user is awarded a badge based on their performance (Platinum Badge, Gold Badge, Silver Badge, or Bronze Badge).

5. End-of-Quiz Summary
   
   After completing the quiz, the user is presented with a summary of their performance. This includes:

   Total score
   Rank
   Badges earned

   A breakdown of each question, showing the correct answer, userâ€™s answer, and whether they were correct or incorrect.

6. Hints (Bonus Feature)
   
   The app includes a hint button that allows users to view the correct answer briefly if they're stuck. A small deduction in time is applied when the hint is used.

7. Sound Effects
   
   The app uses sound effects to provide feedback to the user:

    Correct Answer: Plays a positive sound when the user selects the correct option.

    Incorrect Answer: Plays a negative sound when the user selects the wrong option.

    Completion Sound: Plays a celebration sound when the quiz is completed.
